## Exploring Earthquake Patterns through DBSCAN Clustering 


In this project, we analyzed earthquake patterns in Turkey using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and DBSCAN.

The data is accessible on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serhatk/turkey-20-years-earthquakes-csv) Platform. You can also access my notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gamzeakkurt/turkey-earthquake-analysis-eda-clustering-dbscan). 




## Requirements

To install the requirements, run the following commands:

```sh
pip install dbscan
pip install basemap
pip install basemap-data-hires
pip install plotly

```

## Preprocessing

Before visualizing and extracting features, there were many question marks in the location data, so we fixed this issue. Then, we extracted date-time, earthquake categories, geographical divisions, and seasonal features.

## Results 

All visualizations and results are presented. You can also view the Jupyter Notebook for more details. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly.
